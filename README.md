The calculator on the collaborativecalc branch is a take on a Google Docs like implementation of a calculator where all users collaborate on one calculation. All users are shown the mouse movement and keyclicks of other users and users share a common calculator. A hosted version of this calculator is available at http://calculatewithfriends.com/.
